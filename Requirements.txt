Of course! Here's a Django REST framework exercise to create a simple
RESTful API for managing a list of books. Follow these steps to complete the project:

**Project: Bookstore API**

**Objective**: Create a RESTful API using Django and Django REST framework for managing books.

**Requirements**:

1. Create a new Django project and app for the Bookstore API.
2. Define a model for the book. Each book should have the following attributes:
   - Title
   - Author
   - Publication Year
   - ISBN (International Standard Book Number)
   - Genre
3. Create API endpoints for the following operations:
   - List all books.
   - Retrieve a single book by its ID.
   - Create a new book.
   - Update an existing book.
   - Delete a book.
4. Implement proper validation and error handling for API requests.
5. Use class-based views and serializers from Django REST framework.
6. Ensure that the API returns data in JSON format.
7. Create a user-friendly API documentation using the built-in Django REST framework
 tools (e.g., Browsable API).

**Hints**:

- Create a Django model for the book using Django's `models` module.
- Create a serializer to convert the model data to JSON format.
- Use class-based views like `ListCreateAPIView` and `RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView`
provided by Django REST framework.
- Implement proper URL routing and viewset registration.
- Configure the Django settings to use the Django REST framework for your app.
- You can use Django's built-in authentication system or implement token-based
authentication for securing your API if necessary.
- Make use of the Django REST framework documentation for generating user-friendly
API documentation.

**Bonus**:

- Implement search and filter functionality to search for books by title, author, or genre.
- Add pagination to the list view if there are many books.
- Create unit tests for your API endpoints using Django's testing framework.

This exercise should help you practice creating a RESTful API using Django and
Django REST framework. Feel free to customize and expand upon it to further
enhance your skills in building RESTful services with Django.
